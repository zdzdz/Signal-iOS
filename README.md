# Signal-iOS

## Description
 Signal is a iOS application intended to help people share what they think is inappropriate, report a crime or alert authorities is case of an accident. 

 If someone sees something that he thinks is not correct and deserves to be exposed, he/she can take a picture and leave a comment so that many other can see it. Other times they can be a witness of a crime of sorts and take visual material as an evidence. In such cases or cases of an accident, they can immediately report it to the authorities.

 - The app will have registration form for individual usage.
 - There will be a main scene with a list of all signals.
 - Every user will be able to take a picture or record a video (with gps coordinates) and add a comment.
 - Every user will have a list of his own signals.

 - There will be an option to filter different signals depending on the kind.
